<p><b>Peter Pan</b> is a fictional character created by <a href="">Scottish novelist</a> and playwright <a href="">J. M. Barrie</a>. A free-spirited and mischievous young
    boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures on the mythical island of <a href="">Neverland</a> as the leader of
    the <a href="">Lost Boys</a>, interacting with <a href="">fairies, pirates, mermaids, Native Americans</a>, and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside
    Neverland.</p>

<p>Peter Pan has become a cultural icon symbolizing youthful innocence and <a href="">escapism</a>. In addition to two distinct works by Barrie, <a href=""><i>The Little
    White Bird</i></a> (1902, with chapters 13–18 published in <a href=""><i>Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</i></a> in 1906), and the <a href="">West End stage</a>
    play <a href="">Peter Pan; or, <i>the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</i></a> (1904, which expanded into the 1911 novel <a href=""><i>Peter and Wendy</i></a>), the character
    has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding on Barrie's works. These include several films, television series and many other
    works.</p>

<p>Barrie commissioned a <a href="">statue of Peter Pan</a> by the sculptor <a href="">George Frampton</a>, which was erected overnight in <a href="">Kensington
    Gardens</a> on 30 April 1912 as a surprise to the children of London.<sup><a href="">[1]</a></sup> Six other statues have been cast from the original mould and
    displayed around the world. In 2002, Peter Pan featured on a <a href="">series of UK postage stamps</a> issued by the <a href="">Royal Mail</a> on the centenary of
    Barrie's creation of the character.<sup><a href="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Origin <span class="edit">[<a href="">edit</a>]</span></h2>
<hr>
<p style="margin-top: 2px">Peter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie's <a href=""><i>The Little White Bird</i></a> (1902), a novel for adults. In chapters 13–18, titled "Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens", Peter is a seven-day-old baby and has
    flown from his nursery
    to <a href="">Kensington Gardens</a> in London, where the fairies and birds taught him to fly. He is described as "betwixt-and-between" a boy and a bird. Barrie returned to the character of Peter Pan, putting him at the centre of his <a href="">stage
        play</a> titled <a href="">Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</a>, which premiered on 27 December 1904 at the <a href="">Duke of York's Theatre</a> in London.<sup><a href="">[3]</a></sup> Following the success of the 1904 play,
    Barrie's publishers, <a href="">Hodder and Stoughton</a>, extracted the Peter Pan chapters of <i>The Little White Bird</i> and published them in 1906 under the title <a href="">Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</a>, with the addition of
    illustrations by <a href="">Arthur Rackham</a>.<sup><a href="">[4]</a></sup> Barrie later adapted and expanded the 1904 play's storyline as a <a href="">novel</a>, which was published in 1911 as <a href=""><i>Peter and Wendy</i></a>.</p>
<p>J. M. Barrie may have based the character of Peter Pan on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating accident the day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought of him as forever a boy.<sup><a href="">[5]</a></sup></p>
